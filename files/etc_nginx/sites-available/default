# Drop requests for unknown hosts
#
# If no default server is defined, nginx will use the first found server.
# To prevent host header attacks, or other potential problems when an unknown 
# servername is used in a request, it's recommended to drop the request 
# returning 444 "no response".
#
# From: https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx/blob/master/sites-available/no-default
